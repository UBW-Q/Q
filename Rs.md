## [Cluster Exchange Groupoids and Framed Quadratic Differentials](https://github.com/UBW-Q/ubw-q.github.io/blob/master/Slide/CEG-FQuad.pdf)
> Abstract: We introduce the cluster exchange groupoid associated to a quiver with potential. In the case of the decorated marked surface __S__, the universal cover of this groupoid is a skeleton for a space of suitably framed quadratic differentials on __S__, which in turn models the space Stab(__S__) of Bridgeland stability conditions for the 3-Calabi-Yau (Fukaya) category associated to __S__. Finally, we show that Stab(__S__) is simply connected. This is a joint work with Alastair King. 

## [q-Deformations of Categories, Stability Conditions and Quadratic Differentials](https://github.com/UBW-Q/ubw-q.github.io/blob/master/Slide/q-deformation.pdf)
> Abstract: We introduce Calabi-Yau-X categories D_X as q-deformation of topological Fukaya categories TFuk whose Calabi-Yau-N orbit categories are (subcategories of) derived Fukaya categories. Moreover, we show that TFuk is equivalent to the cluster categories associated to D_X. I will also mention q-deformation of stability conditions (and q-quadratic differentials). This is a joint work with Akishi Ikeda.
